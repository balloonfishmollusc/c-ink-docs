# Part 4: Advanced Flow Control


## 1) Tunnels

The default structure for **ink** stories is a "flat" tree of choices, branching and joining back together, perhaps looping, but with the story always being "at a certain place".

But this flat structure makes certain things difficult: for example, imagine a game in which the following interaction can happen:

	=== crossing_the_date_line ===
	*	"Monsieur!"[] I declared with sudden horror. "I have just realised. We have crossed the international date line!"
	-	Monsieur Fogg barely lifted an eyebrow. "I have adjusted for it."
	*	I mopped the sweat from my brow[]. A relief!
	* 	I nodded, becalmed[]. Of course he had!
	*  I cursed, under my breath[]. Once again, I had been belittled!

...but it can happen at several different places in the story. We don't want to have to write copies of the content for each different place, but when the content is finished it needs to know where to return to. We can do this using parameters:

	=== crossing_the_date_line(-> return_to) ===
	...
	-	-> return_to
	
	...
	
	=== outside_honolulu ===
	We arrived at the large island of Honolulu.
	- (postscript)
		-> crossing_the_date_line(-> done)
	- (done)
		-> END
	
	...
	
	=== outside_pitcairn_island ===
	The boat sailed along the water towards the tiny island.
	- (postscript)
		-> crossing_the_date_line(-> done)
	- (done)
		-> END

Both of these locations now call and execute the same segment of storyflow, but once finished they return to where they need to go next.

But what if the section of story being called is more complex - what if it spreads across several knots? Using the above, we'd have to keep passing the 'return-to' parameter from knot to knot, to ensure we always knew where to return.

So instead, **ink** integrates this into the language with a new kind of divert, that functions rather like a subroutine, and is called a 'tunnel'.

### Tunnels run sub-stories

The tunnel syntax looks like a divert, with another divert on the end:

	-> crossing_the_date_line ->

This means "do the crossing_the_date_line story, then continue from here".

Inside the tunnel itself, the syntax is simplified from the parameterised example: all we do is end the tunnel using the `->->` statement which means, essentially, "go on".

	=== crossing_the_date_line ===
	// this is a tunnel!
	...
	- 	->->

Note that tunnel knots aren't declared as such, so the compiler won't check that tunnels really do end in `->->` statements, except at run-time. So you will need to write carefully to ensure that all the flows into a tunnel really do come out again.

Tunnels can also be chained together, or finish on a normal divert:

	...
	// this runs the tunnel, then diverts to 'done'
	-> crossing_the_date_line -> done
	...
	
	...
	//this runs one tunnel, then another, then diverts to 'done'
	-> crossing_the_date_line -> check_foggs_health -> done
	...

Tunnels can be nested, so the following is valid:

	=== plains ===
	= night_time
		The dark grass is soft under your feet.
		+	[Sleep]
			-> sleep_here -> wake_here -> day_time
	= day_time
		It is time to move on.
	
	=== wake_here ===
		You wake as the sun rises.
		+	[Eat something]
			-> eat_something ->
		+	[Make a move]
		-	->->
	
	=== sleep_here ===
		You lie down and try to close your eyes.
		-> monster_attacks ->
		Then it is time to sleep.
		-> dream ->
		->->

... and so on.


#### Advanced: Tunnels can return elsewhere

Sometimes, in a story, things happen. So sometimes a tunnel can't guarantee that it will always want to go back to where it came from. **ink** supplies a syntax to allow you to "returning from a tunnel but actually go somewhere else" but it should be used with caution as the possibility of getting very confused is very high indeed.

Still, there are cases where it's indispensable:

	=== fall_down_cliff 
	-> hurt(5) -> 
	You're still alive! You pick yourself up and walk on.
	
	=== hurt(x)
		~ stamina -= x 
		{ stamina <= 0:
			->-> youre_dead
		}
	
	=== youre_dead
	Suddenly, there is a white light all around you. Fingers lift an eyepiece from your forehead. 'You lost, buddy. Out of the chair.'

And even in less drastic situations, we might want to break up the structure:

	-> talk_to_jim ->
	 
	 === talk_to_jim
	 - (opts) 	
		*	[ Ask about the warp lacelles ] 
			-> warp_lacells ->
		*	[ Ask about the shield generators ] 
			-> shield_generators ->	
		* 	[ Stop talking ]
			->->
	 - -> opts 
	
	 = warp_lacells
		{ shield_generators : ->-> argue }
		"Don't worry about the warp lacelles. They're fine."
		->->
	
	 = shield_generators
		{ warp_lacells : ->-> argue }
		"Forget about the shield generators. They're good."
		->->
	 
	 = argue 
	 	"What's with all these questions?" Jim demands, suddenly. 
	 	...
	 	->->

#### Advanced: Tunnels use a call-stack

Tunnels are on a call-stack, so can safely recurse.


## 2) Threads

So far, everything in ink has been entirely linear, despite all the branching and diverting. But it's actually possible for a writer to 'fork' a story into different sub-sections, to cover more possible player actions.

We call this 'threading', though it's not really threading in the sense that computer scientists mean it: it's more like stitching in new content from various places.

Note that this is definitely an advanced feature: the engineering stories becomes somewhat more complex once threads are involved!

### Threads join multiple sections together

Threads allow you to compose sections of content from multiple sources in one go. For example:

    == thread_example ==
    I had a headache; threading is hard to get your head around.
    <- conversation
    <- walking


    == conversation ==
    It was a tense moment for Monty and me.
     * "What did you have for lunch today?"[] I asked.
        "Spam and eggs," he replied.
     * "Nice weather, we're having,"[] I said.
        "I've seen better," he replied.
     - -> house
    
    == walking ==
    We continued to walk down the dusty road.
     * [Continue walking]
        -> house
    
    == house ==
    Before long, we arrived at his house.
    -> END

It allows multiple sections of story to combined together into a single section:

    I had a headache; threading is hard to get your head around.
    It was a tense moment for Monty and me.
    We continued to walk down the dusty road.
    1: "What did you have for lunch today?"
    2: "Nice weather, we're having,"
    3: Continue walking

On encountering a thread statement such as `<- conversation`, the compiler will fork the story flow. The first fork considered will run the content at `conversation`, collecting up any options it finds. Once it has run out of flow here it'll then run the other fork.

All the content is collected and shown to the player. But when a choice is chosen, the engine will move to that fork of the story and collapse and discard the others.

Note that global variables are *not* forked, including the read counts of knots and stitches.

### Uses of threads

In a normal story, threads might never be needed.

But for games with lots of independent moving parts, threads quickly become essential. Imagine a game in which characters move independently around a map: the main story hub for a room might look like the following:

	CONST HALLWAY = 1
	CONST OFFICE = 2
	
	VAR player_location = HALLWAY
	VAR generals_location = HALLWAY
	VAR doctors_location = OFFICE
	
	== run_player_location
		{
			- player_location == HALLWAY: -> hallway
		}
	
	== hallway ==
		<- characters_present(HALLWAY)
		*	[Drawers]	-> examine_drawers
		* 	[Wardrobe] -> examine_wardrobe
		*  [Go to Office] 	-> go_office
		-	-> run_player_location
	= examine_drawers
		// etc...
	
	// Here's the thread, which mixes in dialogue for characters you share the room with at the moment.
	
	== characters_present(room)
		{ generals_location == room:
			<- general_conversation
		}
		{ doctors_location == room:
			<- doctor_conversation
		}
		-> DONE
	
	== general_conversation
		*	[Ask the General about the bloodied knife]
			"It's a bad business, I can tell you."
		-	-> run_player_location
	
	== doctor_conversation
		*	[Ask the Doctor about the bloodied knife]
			"There's nothing strange about blood, is there?"
		-	-> run_player_location



Note in particular, that we need an explicit way to return the player who has gone down a side-thread to return to the main flow. In most cases, threads will either need a parameter telling them where to return to, or they'll need to end the current story section.


### When does a side-thread end?

Side-threads end when they run out of flow to process: and note, they collect up options to display later (unlike tunnels, which collect options, display them and follow them until they hit an explicit return, possibly several moves later).

Sometimes a thread has no content to offer - perhaps there is no conversation to have with a character after all, or perhaps we have simply not written it yet. In that case, we must mark the end of the thread explicitly.

If we didn't, the end of content might be a story-bug or a hanging story thread, and we want the compiler to tell us about those.

### Using `-> DONE`

In cases where we want to mark the end of a thread, we use `-> DONE`: meaning "the flow intentionally ends here". If we don't, we might end up with a warning message - we can still play the game, but it's a reminder that we have unfinished business.

The example at the start of this section will generate a warning; it can be fixed as follows:

    == thread_example ==
    I had a headache; threading is hard to get your head around.
    <- conversation
    <- walking
    -> DONE

The extra DONE tells ink that the flow here has ended and it should rely on the threads for the next part of the story.

Note that we don't need a `-> DONE` if the flow ends with options that fail their conditions. The engine treats this as a valid, intentional, end of flow state.

**You do not need a `-> DONE` after an option has been chosen**. Once an option is chosen, a thread is no longer a thread - it is simply the normal story flow once more.

Using `-> END` in this case will not end the thread, but the whole story flow. (And this is the real reason for having two different ways to end flow.)


#### Example: adding the same choice to several places

Threads can be used to add the same choice into lots of different places. When using them this way, it's normal to pass a divert as a parameter, to tell the story where to go after the choice is done.

	=== outside_the_house
	The front step. The house smells. Of murder. And lavender.
	- (top)
		<- review_case_notes(-> top)
		*	[Go through the front door]
			I stepped inside the house.
			-> the_hallway
		* 	[Sniff the air]
			I hate lavender. It makes me think of soap, and soap makes me think about my marriage.
			-> top
	
	=== the_hallway
	The hallway. Front door open to the street. Little bureau.
	- (top)
		<- review_case_notes(-> top)
		*	[Go through the front door]
			I stepped out into the cool sunshine.
			-> outside_the_house
		* 	[Open the bureau]
			Keys. More keys. Even more keys. How many locks do these people need?
			-> top
	
	=== review_case_notes(-> go_back_to)
	+	{not done || TURNS_SINCE(-> done) > 10}
		[Review my case notes]
		// the conditional ensures you don't get the option to check repeatedly
	 	{I|Once again, I} flicked through the notes I'd made so far. Still not obvious suspects.
	- 	(done) -> go_back_to

Note this is different than a tunnel, which runs the same block of content but doesn't give a player a choice. So a layout like:

	<- childhood_memories(-> next)
	*	[Look out of the window]
	 	I daydreamed as we rolled along...
	 - (next) Then the whistle blew...

might do exactly the same thing as:

	*	[Remember my childhood]
		-> think_back ->
	*	[Look out of the window]
		I daydreamed as we rolled along...
	- 	(next) Then the whistle blew...

but as soon as the option being threaded in includes multiple choices, or conditional logic on choices (or any text content, of course!), the thread version becomes more practical.


#### Example: organisation of wide choice points

A game which uses ink as a script rather than a literal output might often generate very large numbers of parallel choices, intended to be filtered by the player via some other in-game interaction - such as walking around an environment. Threads can be useful in these cases simply to divide up choices.

```
=== the_kitchen
- (top)
	<- drawers(-> top)
	<- cupboards(-> top)
	<- room_exits
= drawers (-> goback)
	// choices about the drawers...
	...
= cupboards(-> goback)
	// choices about cupboards
	...
= room_exits
	// exits; doesn't need a "return point" as if you leave, you go elsewhere
	...
```
